# canopywave

Script processing **canopy wave data** [(Mayor, 2017)] seen in lidar scans by the [REAL](http://lidar.csuchico.edu) collected during the CHATS experiment [(Patton et al., 2011)].

This is an alternative approach meant to automatize and extend the work in [(Mayor, 2017)]. It is a work in progress.

## Requirement:
- scientific Python distribution with numpy, scipy, scikit-image, matplotlib;
- the Python `Toolbox` developed for the REAL with database access.
